# Bayesian Networks Lab â€“ Predicting Production Deployment Success

This project was completed as part of my **IDIA4** training at **Polytech Nantes**.  
The objective is to model a phenomenon using a **Bayesian Network**, specifically the **prediction of successful software deployment**.

## Context

Deploying a new feature to production is a risky process, influenced by many technical and human factors.  
This lab proposes a simplified probabilistic model of this process through variables such as:

- Developer experience  
- Presence of automated tests  
- Quality of technical documentation  
- Test results  
- Availability of a pre-production environment  

## Objectives

- Identify relevant discrete variables  
- Build a Bayesian Network graph modeling dependencies  
- Implement the model using a Python library (`pyAgrum`)  
- Simulate different scenarios and observe success probabilities  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- `pyAgrum` (for Bayesian modeling)  
- Jupyter Notebook
